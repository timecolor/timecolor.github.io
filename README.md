# What Colour is it? Website version

original website (http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org/) is down, so i created a new one.                                                       
Go to http://timecolor.github.io                                                  

I DID NOT CREATE THIS WEBSITE                                                                                                            
the maker is https://github.com/Jonic

BTW I CREATED  THE ICON
